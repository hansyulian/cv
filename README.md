#### Q: Why did you build your own online CV?

While there are existing services for creating CVs, I chose to build my own for several reasons:

- To showcase my skills
- To maintain full control over styling and code
- To use the same structured data for various purposes
- Free
- Because I enjoy coding, I found building this CV more engaging than using traditional office software

#### Q: Can I use your code to generate my own CV?

Yes, you can use my code, provided you follow the format or any future format I may create. You can modify the data and use your browser’s print function to generate a PDF of the CV.

Please note that some settings for an optimal layout might need adjustment:

- Set the print size to A3
- Set print margins to none
- Enable background colors

#### Q: I'm a software engineer and I would like to fork your repository to build my own CV. Can I?

I would recommend building your own CV from scratch if you're a software engineer. While you can fork this repository, it's intended to showcase my skills. I encourage you to create your own CV using technologies you're comfortable with to demonstrate your own abilities.

#### Q: How can I contribute to or suggest improvements for this repository?

If you have suggestions for improvements, feel free to reach out. I aim to personally code this repository to demonstrate my skills.

#### Q: Are there any specific challenges or lessons learned during the development of this project?

While there were not many challenges, I aimed to build this CV with future expandability in mind. I considered creating new templates or even developing this repository further into a SaaS platform. I believe it’s essential to build even a simple project with scalability in mind while avoiding overengineering.

#### Q: Did you build this using ChatGPT?

Yes and no. Most of the part I perform the coding myself. That's why you may see many variables and others aren't so nicely worded unlike when generating code using ChatGPT. The comments also aren't that excessive like ChatGPT. I only put comments on some parts that personally I might forgot in the future, just a reminder for the future myself. Some parts that I do use ChatGPT for example:

- Please generate the regex for email
- Please generate unit test for this function
- Please touch up the wording of my data here
- i have this markdown file for my online CV github repo. I have some Q&A that i put here, can you give me some recommendation of questions that i should answer as well before i give to you again later to touch up?
- This is the readme for my repository, please touch up this markdown, also generate the index for the Q&A part so people can navigate quickly (yes this markdown is also enhanced by ChatGPT)
- Generate the index for this Q&A
